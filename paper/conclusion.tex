\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The lack of gender diversity in technology is well established but poorly understood. Many research studies show that men significantly outnumber women at all levels of tech culture and are more confident in their own technical skills, despite a lack of evidence that men are any more skilled than women in these fields. These studies tend to address a single stage of education or career, however, and do not provide a sense of overall progress. In this project, I constructed a resource to connect these disparate data sources on women's participation in technology. It provides an overview of the traditional tech education-to-career pipeline, along with narrative descriptions that provide commentary and context for that data. It enables viewers to answer basic questions about gender diversity in tech and provides resources for further exploration, from datasets to media coverage to corporate diversity policies.

However, there is ample room to revise and expand the project, and I intend to continue developing further. Additional interactivity on the current graphs will allow viewers to explore in more depth without the need to process the data themselves, while including supplementary data will draw attention to the unique challenges faced at each stage of the pipeline.
