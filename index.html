      <h1>Women Who Tech</h1>
      <p class='intro'>Let's face it: tech has a diversity problem. Women and other minorities earn fewer tech degrees, get fewer tech jobs, and leave companies and degree programs sooner than their white male colleagues, even as colleges and tech companies trumpet their commitment to diversity. Many companies blame this on the “leaky pipeline” of tech education, claiming that degree programs just aren't producing enough qualified minority candidates. But reality, as always, is more complex.</p>
      <p class='intro'>Scroll to explore the tech education pipeline: high school students studying computer science, college and graduate students earning technical degrees, and employees working in tech.</p>
      <div id='pipes' class='svg-container' style='padding-bottom:21%'></div>
      <p class='intro'>All the data presented here focuses on students and employees in the United States. We're showing the data on gender diversity, but we believe ethnic diversity is also problematic—and women of color face the biggest obstacles of all. All of our data sources are publicly available, and most include ethnic diversity stats, too—check the <a href='#resources'>resources list</a> for links to explore more.</p>

    <h2>Gendered Computing</h2>
    <p>In the age of ubiquitous computing, your gender shouldn't affect your access to technology: with smartphone in hand, everyone of every gender has instant access to the collected wisdom of the internet. So why do so many boys than girls start tinkering with their tech?</p>
    <p>It turns out that tech toys show the same gender differences we see in most kinds of play: boys typically spend more time trying to outdo each other, while girls typically spend time socializing and collaborating. With technology, boys are more often encouraged to tinker, and they spend more time playing games—which easily leads to exploring computer hardware (to build or upgrade a computer) and software (to create custom tools or modifications). Girls, on the other hand, often use technology primarily to socialize, teaching them to use the platforms that other people build without any incentive to make their own.</p>

      <p class='small-label'>Data: AP Test Demographics for Computer Science [Source: <a href="https://research.collegeboard.org/programs/ap/data">The College Board</a>]</p>
      <p>High school students can take the Advanced Placement Computer Science exam to earn college credit for high school coursework in computing. Recently, more of the students taking the exam are female, and their average score has increased. Boys are still more likely to take the test and to earn top scores, though, so there's still work to do.</p>

    <h2>Expectations Affect Outcomes</h2>
    <p>Modern tech culture depends on genius.</p>
    <p>We celebrate the ideal of the creative visionary and the brilliant developer, even as we discuss the best ways to teach programming and design thinking to people who don't have that natural spark. Consequently, when college students arrive in introductory computer science classes, the students who get the most praise are the ones who are already know how to program—mostly, young white men who were exposed to codign in high school (or earlier). Students without prior experience feel left behind, even in introductory classes.</p>
    <p>Couple that with the awkwardness of being the outnumbered by at least 7-to-1 in a large lecture hall, and it's no wonder that young women are disproportionately likely to drop a computer science major or minor.</p>

      <p>The number of degrees awarded in computer engineering, computer science, and information science and technology has nearly doubled in the last five years. Information science has seen the greatest increase, both in overall graduates and in the proportion of female graduates.</p>

    <h2>Learning How to Tech</h2>
    <p>The first computers were women, not machines, who performed computations. When mechanical computers were first introduced, many of the people who used them were still female, and in 1984 women made up nearly 40% of computer science graduates. Now, that number is around 18%.</p>
    <p>Computer science curricula that emphasize collaboration and applied problem solving, rather than computation and efficiency, seem promising in attracting and retaining more female students. Fewer women drop courses that use collaborative techniques like pair programming, and female enrollment is higher in courses that emphasize community-based problem solving.</p>

      <p class='small-label'>Data: Graduate degrees awarded in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Information [Source: <a href="http://cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey/">The Taulbee Survey</a>]</p>
      <p>Uniquely among tech degrees, graduate degrees in information science and technology are awarded almost equally to men and women. There are several plausible explanations: they're the most likely to be found in a professional school that emphasizes interdisciplinarity and applied problem-solving; they're also frequently found in library schools, which are overwhelmingly female. This provides an approachable introduction to skills like database design or web development for women who may not have had much tech exposure in their undergraduate program.</p>

    <h2>When is a Pipeline not a Pipeline?</h2>
    <p>The “leaky pipeline” metaphor is great for highlighting the problems with traditional, four-year tech degrees, but it ignores all of the other avenues for technical training. Vocational degrees, professional certificates, and boot camps all aim to teach professional tech skills, and women are more likely to pursue this training or to transition laterally into a more technical role. Recruiting that relies on the personal networks of computer science graduates are more likely to miss the talent coming from these nontraditional channels.</p>
    <p>Especially with the rise of professionally-oriented programs (like design or development boot camps), we need better ways of identifying and cultivating talented designers, developers, and other technologists, no matter their academic pedigree. After all, if technology is everywhere, shouldn't we expect tech people everywhere, too?</p>

      <p class='small-label'>Data: Detailed Employment by Gender &amp; Occupation [Source: <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/tables.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>]</p>
      <p>In the last few years, more organizations are realizing the advantages of diversity: with more backgrounds and perspectives to draw on, teams are better at creatively solving problems for large and diverse audiences. Despite all this discussion, the numbers haven't changed much. While there are more women working in tech, that's because there are more people working in tech, and the ratio of women to men is still small.</p>
      <p>According to federal employment statistics, web development and database administration are the computing occupations closest to gender parity, with around 33% female employees in each. More granular reports, like the annual <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2017#developer-profile-developer-role-and-gender">Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a>, suggest that data science and other statistics-based roles are also relatively open to women.</p>

    <h2>How to Hire Qualified Women</h2>
    <p>If companies want to hire more qualified women, they need to hire more women.</p>
    <p>Sure, it sounds simplistic. But there are women who are perfectly qualified to work in tech who are looking for work or who are employed in a job unrelated to their technical training. The traditional education pipeline isn't perfect, but it's not the only way people prepare themselves for careers in tech.</p>
    <p>Yes, it's easier to hire people referred by colleagues who've proven themselves already. Yes, it can seem risky to hire the woman who might not fit the company's culture. But aren't we trying to make the world better? Since when is that easy or safe?</p>

      <h2>Tech Company Diversity Reports</h2>
