\section{Introduction}
Technology in modern society is ubiquitous, economically explosive, and culturally male. The stereotype of the young white male software developer is still the norm in information technology (IT) fields, even after decades of intervention to increase diversity in tech. According to the National Center for Women in Tech, in 2015 women made up 57\% of the U.S. workforce but held just 25\% of professional computing jobs; they likewise received more than half of all U.S. bachelor's degrees but only 17\% of degrees in computer science, down from 37\% in 1985 \citep{NCWIT2016Women}. Despite the large body of research documenting the underrepresentation of women in IT, technology has not seen the same progress toward gender parity observed in the other STEM fields. This project uses interactive visualization to present this research to a general audience, highlighting the persistent gender imbalance within IT\@.

\section{Project Overview}
This resource connects prior research on women's representation across IT, from high school to employment, to present an interactive visualization of the state of women in technology. It combines several publicly available datasets, spanning the education pipeline from high school to employment in computing, over the last several years, allowing viewers to explore not only the current state of gender diversity in computing but recent trends across the stages of the pipeline. Short narrative explanations provide context for each visualization, suggesting features of the dataset that viewers may want to explore.
