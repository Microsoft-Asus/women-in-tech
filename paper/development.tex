\subsection{Project Development}\label{development}
\subsubsection{Process and Tools}
After fleshing out secondary personas and a few use cases, the development process will begin with exploratory data analysis both to clean the data and to shape a narrative for the final visualization. This exploratory analysis will primarily be done using the R software package, with additional tools like Google Refine to speed data cleaning.

Next, low-fidelity storyboards and paper prototypes will allow me to quickly collect feedback on designs for the final visualization. The visualization itself will be created in Javascript, using the D3.js visualization library.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}
Because this project focuses on design and development rather than user testing, there will not be a formal usability evaluation of the final visualization. However, I will be designing with usability principles in mind, and I intend to solicit informal feedback to incorporate into the final visualization.
