\subsection{Data Sources}
The overview requires at least three data sources: demographic breakdowns for high school technology students, for college and graduate students pursuing IT degrees, and for women employed in technical fields. I plan to use the College Board’s AP Computer Science demographics for high school, the Computing Research Association’s Taulbee Survey for college and graduate school, and federal labor statistics for employment. All three datasets are publicly available online with several years of historical data, and all three have been used in both research and advocacy work.

The detailed views will incorporate more specific data in each category, likely involving supplementary datasets. In particular, I would like to provide additional data for the higher education and career phases to explore the pipeline metaphor: attrition rates among computer science majors to illustrate the proverbial leaks, and the prevalence of professional women with alternate career paths to demonstrate its oversimplicity. I would also like to include a breakdown of professional technologists by role or job title, perhaps from a source like the Stack Overflow User Census.
