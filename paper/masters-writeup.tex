\section{Introduction}
Technology in modern society is ubiquitous, economically explosive, and culturally male. The stereotype of the young white male software developer is still the norm in information technology (IT) fields, even after decades of intervention to increase diversity in tech. According to the National Center for Women in Tech, in 2015 women made up 57\% of the U.S. workforce but held just 25\% of professional computing jobs; they likewise received more than half of all U.S. bachelor's degrees but only 17\% of degrees in computer science, down from 37\% in 1985 \citep{NCWIT2016Women}. Despite the large body of research documenting the underrepresentation of women in IT, technology has not seen the same progress toward gender parity observed in the other STEM fields. This project uses interactive visualization to present this research to a general audience, highlighting the persistent gender imbalance within IT\@.

\section{Project Overview}
%% TODO: Convert from future plan to actual description %%
My project will connect prior research on women’s representation across IT, from high school to employment, to present an interactive visualization of the state of women in technology. The visualization’s narrative will be crafted after an exploratory analysis of the available datasets; preliminarily, it will center on the proportion of women in each stage of the traditional IT pipeline, from high school to employment. It will also include more detailed information about each stage---for instance, the AP score breakdown for high schoolers, or a view by job title for career technologists---that may help evaluate the pipeline metaphor itself.
